# AoC
My personal Advent of Code contributions.<br>
Each year in separate directories.<br>
My experience varies a lot between years, I began my python journey on AoC, 
so it will vary from noob and evolve slowly (:>*<br>
The code isn't necessarily done in the year of the events and at the date of release.
